# Things I'm Working On #

If you came here looking for a showcase of one-off client sites, and fancy visuals I'm sorry to disappoint you. What you are looking at is a list of long-term projects that I'm actively involved in. It includes both personal projects that I've started and collective projects that I contribute to.

Don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:hello@iljapanic.me) if you are working on something and think I could help you with it.
