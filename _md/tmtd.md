In 2012, I used the domain and the site to get accepted to a university in Denmark. Since then I've transformed the site into an information resource to help people who are planning to move to Denmark.

Currently, the site is a bit dated. Visual design, in particular, is an example of poor taste of past me. But don't worry, a new version with updated content and new features is in the pipes.

I'm looking for people to help me with creating, maintaining, and running the site. So please reach out if you would like to collaborate on this project.
