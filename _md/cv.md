I write, I code, I design, I sketch, I research, I analyse. Heck, I do it all. I'm a front-end developer, UX designer, what-not ninja, social media guru and a T-shaped unicorn. Labels, labels, labels. Box 1, Box 2, Box 3. You go here, he goes there, and I go who knows where.

No, but now for real. I'm not a big fan of labels and job titles. They restrict what you are “allowed” to work on, give others a skewed ideas of what to expect of you, and they plague the industry with dogmatic thinking. If I was asked to give myself a title it would be a **digital strategist** and **information designer**. Not because it sounds sophisticated, but because it best describe what I do. I analyse relationships between people and information and I use the digital medium to communicate strategically with people.

People come to your site to accomplish a real-life goal. They are looking for information, most often in the form of text. They did not come to play with your pixel-perfect interface or to admire your blazing-fast MEAN stack. Your site or product needs to communicate effectively with your customers and help them accomplish their goals. If you can do it fast and delight them along the way you get extra credit.

I'm here to help you communicate effectively with people online and to make the Web more human while at it.
