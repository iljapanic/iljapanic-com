Folkmatic is a freshly founded, up and coming agency based in Copenhagen/Belgrade. The company focuses on delivering high-end digital products and building lasting relationships with its clients using the network and know-how acquired from work at the previous agency. At this point, I was back in school and working only part-time. So unlike my previous agency stint, this one involved more focused, project-based work, and also more responsibility. Usually, I got assigned as the only front-end dev to a project where I've worked in close tandem with a back-end dev and a project manager. I've often worked remotely at my own time in weekly iterations.
