- Daniel Dennett - From Bacteria to Bach and Back Again
- technology gives us cognitive capabilities that would be inaccessible without it
	- ‘Google makes me smarter’
	- Marshall McLuhan -> extension of human mind via technology
- ‘unknown knowns’ shape our thinking more than we realise -> they constantly change -> co-evolution
- memes can’t exist independent of the human mind
- technological artefacts can exist independently of human mind, much like living organisms:
	- they feed on / consume energy (fossil fuels, solar)
	- they can catch diseases (viruses)
	- they have an immune system (AI that removes malicious Wikipedia edits)
- when machines break they need a human to fix them -> creation of a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines
- **techno-spieces**
- computer are helping humans make computer better
- current world can’t function without software, creating a dependant symbiotic relationship with machines
- ruthless rules of biological revolution apply to technology and culture as well, only the most dominant ones survive
	- technological artefacts die out (programming languages)
	- cultural artefacts and memes die out too (clerks, travel agents)
- our symbiotic relationship with technology will (hopefully) protect us from the potential dangers of AI
- intelligence is very multi-faceted and non-linear
- we are probably not going to like the machines that are too human-like -> it would disrupt the symbiotic relationship
	- we have enough human minds on the planet, so let the machines do what they do better than the human mind
	- there is a biblical appeal to creating a human-like machine
- our culture may not be able to keep up with accelerating technological change
- we will need to change our social structures
- we need to understand our current situation better if we are to fix it
	-  the narrative of AI vs humans and AI obliterating the human kind is a misguided
- the slow cultural change should be considered a benefit
- suppression of information is real, but compared to the past we are much better off than ever before in the history
- **we live in an age of unprecedented information fluidity**
- making privately-owned black-boxed AI systems more transparent may necessarily help because nobody has a comprehensive insight into their operations -> nevertheless, we need to make large private companies and governments accountable
- there is a historical tendency to model the brain according to the current dominant technology (brain works like a steam engine)
	- digital technology and algorithms shape our current view of the functioning of the brain
	- there is nothing universal or all-encompassing about digital technology
	- many parts of our brain might out of scope of digital technologies
- in the process of conveying our ideas through language and then letting them form in someone else’s head we loose a large portion of information - both ideas are going to be completely different
- we only have access to **noisy channels** of communication
- **a lot of what goes on in our heads is not digitally encodable**
- the thesis that human cognition is entirely digitally encodable can’t be falsified -> therefore we can never know
	- if your mind is uploaded to a computer there is no way of knowing -> only if we come up with an absolutely noiseless transmission (physically impossible with our current knowledge)
	- this puts in doubt the whole idea of singularity
- we are the only species that can lear from people we have never met before, which markedly magnifies our cognitive capabilities
- ‘arms race’ between AI systems is likely -> we need to come up with methods and processes to protect systems from being undermined by other systems
- a theory of medicine for protecting technological artefacts
