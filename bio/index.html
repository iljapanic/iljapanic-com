<p>Because of lousy grades from high school I ended up in an university I didn&#39;t like. So I made a website that helped me get admitted to an university in Copenhagen and I moved to Denmark.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a fan of job banks and long forms. So I made an interactive CV and sent it out to bunch of agencies around Copenhagen. It landed me an internship and subsequently a job at an agency.</p>
<p>Normally, you write a case study for your bachelor project at a business school. I got away with writing a non-businessy paper about Information Design instead. To make it more interesting I wrote it using Markdown, Gulp and other Web technologies.</p>
<hr>
<p>I love doing normal things in an untraditional way. I&#39;ve always been like that and the Web proved to be a life-changing medium for me in this respect. It helped me contemplate my life journey they way I wanted. Now I&#39;m using all that I&#39;ve learned over the years to help make the Web work for others as well.</p>
<p>I write, I code, I design, I sketch, I research, I analyse. Heck, I do it all. I&#39;m a front-end developer, UX designer, information architect, what-not ninja, social media guru and a T-shaped unicorn. Labels, labels, labels. Box 1, Box 2, Box 3. You go here, he goes there, and I go who knows where.</p>
<p>No, but now for real. I&#39;m not a big fan of labels and job titles. They restrict what you are “allowed” to work on, they limit your potential and they give others a skewed ideas of what to expect from you. They also plague the industry with dogmas and bs arguments about who is supposed to do what and how.</p>
<p>If I was asked to give myself a title it would be a <strong>digital strategist</strong> and an <strong>information designer</strong>. Not because it sounds sophisticated, but because it best describe what I do. I analyse relationships between people, information, and technology. I use the digital medium to communicate purposefully with other people by designing meaningful information artefacts. I use a variety of tools and methods to accomplish this. But the technology itself does not interest me that much. I&#39;m interested in people and how the things we make in this virtual space fit into their everyday lives.</p>
<p>People come to your site to accomplish real-life goals. They did not come to play with your pixel-perfect interface or to admire your blazing-fast MEAN stack (just look at Craigslist). They are looking for information, most often in the textual form, that will help them accomplish their goals. If you can provide them with such information quickly and delight them with subtle interactions along the way you get bonus points.</p>
<p>I&#39;m here to help you communicate effectively with people online and to make the Web more human while at it.</p>
