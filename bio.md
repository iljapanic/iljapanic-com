Iâ€™m Ilja Panic, a designer and technologist. I'm currently based in London where I'm doing my master's in Smart Cities & Urban Analytics.


In 2012, I got tired of the university in my hometown of Prague and made a website takemetodenmark.com that got me accepted to Copenhagen Business School. During my studies, I have worked as a front-end developer at two digital agencies and eventually set my own freelance business specialising in Web Development, Information Architecture and UX Design.

After two years of freelancing, I've moved to London in the autumn of 2017 to pursue a master's degree at UCL and to connect with one of the world's most vibrant cities.

I'm passionate about technology and its role in the society. I'm interested in a broad spectrum of themes revolving around human-centred design, HCI, computational ethics, information behaviour and ubiquitous computing.
