<p>Fontai is an IT project management network delivering highly personalized technological solutions to its client base. My role in the company was overseeing the development of Weetr mailing tool. The tool is primarily used by company&#39;s clients to send newsletters and service messages. I&#39;ve prepared presentation slides and promo materials with pricing. Collaborated with the graphic designer on newsletter prototypes for clients. And tested out new features with the main developer.</p>
