<p>The internship at Spoiled Milk was my first full-blown professional experience where I got introduced to the hectic and messy world of agency client work. I&#39;ve primarily worked on transforming designs into HTML/CSS/JS templates. I&#39;ve been one of the go-to-guys for much of ad-hoc front-end tasks; jumping back-and-forth between several projects a day, smashing bugs, fixing IE8 issues, and implementing new functionality. I also coded up a lot of “responsive” email templates, so I got to see how Web used to be made and learned to hate MS Outlook even more. Occasionally, I&#39;ve designed some UI concepts and prototypes. I&#39;ve worked on everything from an enterprise Web app to a startup teaser page.</p>
