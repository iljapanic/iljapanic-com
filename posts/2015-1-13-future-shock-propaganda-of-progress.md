# Future Shock & Propaganda of Progress

We are all living in an age of unprecentedet propaganda of progress.

The expontential pace of advances 

The older generation is conditioned to view themselves as powerless actors in a gory world of ever-present danger. People of middle age sole wory is how to make sure their offsprings survive whatever is to come, but what that something is they dont know. They too feel powerless because they lost the grasp of the speed with which we are pushing ahead. Because of this lack of understanding much of their wisdom hits deff ears in a form of truisms and general truths about life and moral values.

I myself am a part of the so called ‘Generation Y’. We are somewhere in between the utterly hopeless older folks and the youngerters absolutely consumed by modern technology. And needless to say, we are currently the most confused of all. We feel that something is wrong with the status quo but we can’t quite put our finger on it.

2012, end of the world, was not an actual end of the world. It was a metaphorical shift in conciousnes that marked a beginning of new era. The world is brewing like crazy and its massive implosions is already long overdue. We are slowly freeing ourselves from the false dichotomy of capitalism VS communism. There is something new on the horizon and we still don’t have a word for it.






We feel that we are quickly approaching the moment when we are going to take over the steering wheel of the worldwide institutions from stumborn industrialists who seem determined to hold onto it until their last breath.


We live in an environment in which we are blasted with millions upon millions of audio-visual and spatial stimuli on daily basis. When we are not defending ourselves from this stimuli in the commercialized public space, we go home, just so we can numb ourselves down with an endless stream of trivia and get lost in our increasingly personalized information bubbles.

No wonder that most of us can’t make sense of it and feel hopeless.

We are conditioned to view the latest advances in science and technology a something from a sci-fi movie and a matter of distant future. The business sector is already applying those same technologies on a massive scale. All while the global military-industry complex is sitting on decades worth of advancements that even the most creative minds can’t begin to imagine.

The advancments in science and technology are not a matter of tomorrow’s sci-fi. Tomorrow is today. The future is now. And people need to be aware of it. We all need to understand that the grave consequence our decisions today have on our lives tomorrow and the lives of our children. We need to rid ourselves of dogmatic thinking and extremism in any form or shape. We need to critically reasses and reevaluate every single aspect of our lives.

Our relentless consumption and preoccupance with triviality and violence are mere symptoms of the way we approach our lives. Too many of us are passively accepting whatever comes our way, rarely stopping to ask questions. Many even conciously prefere to continue living in this massive augmented reality constructed by our collective minds. The reality is harsh. But denying it or ignoring it makes it even worse. The denial phase is over. We need to stop pretending everything is fine. Not tomorrow, not today, but now.
