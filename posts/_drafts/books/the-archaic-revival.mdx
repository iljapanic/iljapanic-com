A mind-bending collection of essay exploring the outermost fringes of consciousness.

McKenna's profound gift is in the ability to construct new ways of thinking about reality through mastery of language.

This book can't be read through a rationalist positivist lens. Rather it is meant to spark imagination and offer a glimpse into alternative planes of reality.
