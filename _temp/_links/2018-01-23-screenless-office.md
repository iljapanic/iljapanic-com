A well-articulated polemic against contemporary digital design culture with its penchant for glossy screen-based interfaces. The proposed paper-based form is not necessarily meant to be practical. It serves more as a provocation and an exercise for sparking a discussion about our relationship with everyday technology.

The focus is on a more deliberate interactions and slow computing, similar to Weiser's vision of [calm technology](https://calmtech.com/papers.html) and [the computer for the 21st century](http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/SciAmDraft3.html), or G. Krishna's book [The Best Interface Is No Interface](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22758923-the-best-interface-is-no-interface).

It would be nice to see a more detailed description and examples of the actual screenless interfaces.

“Currently, it exists as a working prototype with software "bureaus" which allow a user to read and navigate news, web sites and social media entirely with the use of various printers for output and a barcode scanner for input.”

“In this sense, it is freed from the implicit social requirement that new technological projects conform to standard principles of progress, universality and efficiency.”

“Because screen-based interaction is premised on temporal immediacy, we are, as users forced into a state of hyper-attention where we must constantly fight against the, largely commercial, attempts to make us look at something else. When we remove the screen (and by necessity, simplify the interface) we introduce a new form of temporality, where the speed of interaction might more accurately reflect our ability to percieve and understand information.”
