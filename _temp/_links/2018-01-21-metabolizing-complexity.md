“The Age of Oracular Algorithms.”

“Entities that can successfully model a complex problem space control that space.”

“Access to the ability to model complex systems defines ‘wealth’ today.”

“Modelling and simulating complex adaptive systems is vastly, ‘inhumanly’, computationally expensive.” - The amount of computational power required to extract patters from massive amounts of data is prohibitively expensive so it is only available to large institutions.

Study of chaotic systems. You can’t model messiness, but you can know its tides, texture and rhythms to make your way into a relationship with messiness from a computational perspective.

“Exploitations of the lizard brain.” - The machines are looking for the shortest possible feedback loop between our desire and its fulfilment through transaction. (swipe right, pull to refresh)

In our race for optimal flow, we have discarded contemplation in our relationship with computation.

A call for instruments for exploration and expression.

Playful explorations of data sets.

“Each simulation is just a shadow of a complex system.”
