<p>In 2012, I used the domain and the site to get accepted to a university in Denmark. Since then I&#39;ve transformed the site into an information resource to help people who are planning to move to Denmark.</p>
<p>Currently, the site is a bit dated. Visual design, in particular, is an example of poor taste of past me. But don&#39;t worry, a new version with updated content and new features is in the pipes.</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking for people to help me with creating, maintaining, and running the site. So please reach out if you would like to collaborate on this project.</p>
