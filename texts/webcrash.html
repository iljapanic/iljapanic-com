<p>A latest personal project which I hope to make a collective one soon. The project long-term ambition is to curate resources about design and web development and create a network of people running workshops in their local communities and businesses</p>
<p>The idea of the workshops is for people to acquire a working knowledge of any given tool, even if they never seen code before. While also learning the core principles and design rationale behind common Web patterns. It is important that people walk out of the workshop with their creations available online and ready for further experiments.</p>
<p>So far, I&#39;ve only organized small workshops at my university and the materials are in a very poor state. I&#39;m currently preparing next workshop so you can expect to see updated repos soon.</p>
<p>Get in touch if you would like to join forces and organize a workshop or otherwise get involved with the project.  </p>
