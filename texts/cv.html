<p>I&#39;m what people call a generalist. I do a lot of things, some of those I do quite well. Technically, I&#39;m most comfortable at the Web front-end. Conceptually, I got a broad knowledge of relationship between people and digital medium and I use this knowledge to design meaningful information products. </p>
