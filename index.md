My name is Ilja Panic. I'm a designer and technologist from Prague currently based in Barcelona.

I'm an avid student of emerging technologies and its role in society. Iâ€™m researching a range of themes revolving around information design, HCI, computational ethics, information behaviour and ubiquitous computing.

I run a solo freelance company specialising in Web development and advising clients with their UX strategy.

Don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm always on a lookout for exciting projects and interesting people to collaborate with.
