My name is Ilja, I'm a designer and technologist from Prague currently based in Barcelona.

I'm an avid student of emerging technologies and its role in society. I research a wide range of themes related to ubiquitous computing, information design, human-computer interaction, computational ethics, and information behaviour. I also run a solo company specialising in Web development and advising clients with UX strategy.

I love coffee, books and vinyl.

Don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm always on a lookout for exciting projects and interesting people to collaborate with.
