Hello there online stranger.

My name is Ilja and I welcome you to my little corner of the Web.

I am an avid student of technology and its role in society. Iâ€™m interested in a range of themes revolving around information design, HCI, computational ethics, information behavior and ubiquitous computing.

I like to drink black coffee, play basketball, listen to eccentric music and read dense books.

This site is work in progress. Some parts may be unfinished, sound sloppy or work strangely in older browsers. Feedback and suggestions are appreciated.
