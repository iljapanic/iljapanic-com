My name is Ilja Panic. I'm a designer and technologist from Prague currently based in Barcelona.

I'm an avid student of emerging technologies and its role in society. I do research in a wide range of themes revolving around ubiquitous computing, information design, human-computer interaction, computational ethics, information behaviour. I also run a solo company specialising in Web development and advising clients with their UX strategy.

Don't hesitate to get in touch. I'm always on a lookout for exciting projects and interesting people to collaborate with.
