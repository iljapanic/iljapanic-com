I've also completed [Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org) as part of the program. I've documented the studies on a [dedicated website](https://mdef.iljapanic.com/). As my final project, I've designed and developed Cyberbiomes - a conceptual framework for exploring interspecies modes of communication. This project took the form of an [essay](https://iljapanic.com/cyberbiomes), a [web repository](https://cyberbiomes.org/), and an [interactive installation](https://cyberbiomes.org/cyberbiome).",
