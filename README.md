Code behind my personal website

Documentation may come some time in the future. Meanwhile, if you have any questions regarding the code shoot me an email at [hello@iljapanic.me](mailto:hello@iljapanic.me)


## Plugins
The site would not be possible without borrowing code from others who are better JS ninjas that I am. Big thanks goes to talented people behind following plugins:

- [classie](https://github.com/desandro/classie) (by [@desandro](https://github.com/desandro))
- [SmartUnderline](https://github.com/EagerIO/SmartUnderline) (by Adam Schwartz at [@EagerIO](https://github.com/EagerIO/))
