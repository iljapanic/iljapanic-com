    I'm a multi-disciplinary designer making web applications and researching the cultural impacts of emergent technologies. I'm fascinated with cybernetics, inter-species interfaces, and ways of bridging natural and technological systems. I dabble with 3D printing, robotics, parametric design, no-code workflows, and various tools for thought.

    Head over to [about](./about/) to learn more about my background and what I do. Take a look at my [virtual bookshelf](./library/) or read [articles and essays](./articles/) I wrote over the course of various studies.

    I have a few new sections coming up to this site. Drop your email below and I will let you know when they are live.
