            <div class="company__text">
                <p>Folkmatic is a freshly founded, up and coming agency based in Copenhagen/Belgrade. The company focuses on delivering high-end digital products and building lasting relationships with its clients using the network and know-how acquired from work at the previous agency. At this point, I was back in school and working only part-time. So unlike my previous agency stint, this one involved more focused, project-based work, and also more responsibility. Usually, I got assigned as the only front-end dev to a project where I&#39;ve worked in close tandem with a back-end dev and a project manager. I&#39;ve often worked remotely at my own time in weekly iterations.</p>

            <div class="company__position">Front-end Development Intern (full-time)</div>
            <div class="company__text">
                <p>The internship at Spoiled Milk was my first full-blown professional experience where I got introduced to the hectic and messy world of agency client work. I&#39;ve primarily worked on transforming designs into HTML/CSS/JS templates. I&#39;ve been one of the go-to-guys for much of ad-hoc front-end tasks; jumping back-and-forth between several projects a day, smashing bugs, fixing IE8 issues, and implementing new functionality. I also coded up a lot of “responsive” email templates, so I got to see how Web used to be made and learned to hate MS Outlook even more. Occasionally, I&#39;ve designed some UI concepts and prototypes. I&#39;ve worked on everything from an enterprise Web app to a startup teaser page.</p>
