We've all been there. You got hundreds of notes that you've been pilling up for years in a disjointed array of apps and tools.

Unfortunately, such approach breaks as your collection grows. Sooner   or later you inevitably loose sense of where is what.

Furthermore, it doesn't allow you to see the connection between all those great ideas you had over the years.

Digital tools conditioned us too perceive this top-down hierarchical approach as the only way to organize information in our virtual workspaces.

You know that feeling when you want to create a new note and you get stuck trying to figure out where to put it? This breaks our flow and causes friction to our thinking. 

In this workshop we will learn to use a more organic approach to capturing and managing your endless stream of ideas. A method that is more aligned with how our minds work.

I've been successfully applying the method presented here for over a year and I have never felt more comfortable “forgetting” things because I rest assured that I will them when needed.


The method you are about to learn provides a wonderful antidote to the

## Why do a workshop with me?

Over the past ten years, I've tried literally hundreds of tools, services, methods, hacks and workflows for knowledge management and better productivity. Bullet Journal, Evernote, Bear, Ulysses, Notion, Pocket, Goodreads, Trello, Things, Airtable, Basecamp, Zapier, Readwise, Roam Research, Feedbin — you name it, I've probably tried it.

I follow dozens of newsletters, RSS feeds and curated sources. I test out new tools on daily basis (most of which I abandon after a few minutes). Heck, I even have a degree in Information Management. This gives me a good understanding of different ways we approach and deal with information.  

I'm excited to share these years of know-how with anyone interested in taming their scattered attention and creating a more meaningful relationship with technologies.
