In the last few days, Twitter has been going crazy about GPT-3 – a new language prediction model developed by OpenAI. An AI safety researcher Ed Leon Klinger described it as ”a computer program that can interact like a ridiculously intelligent human”, he also said that “Today the world changed forever”.

Some people are already prophetizing the imminent arrival of AGI - Artificial General Intelligence - the kind that we know from dystopian sci-fi narratives, an actual thinking machine. Here, I'm siding with the critics who claim that this is still just a brute statistical model that doesn't have a comprehensive understanding of the world it operates in. However, that doesn't mean that the applications based on the GPT-3 model will not be disruptive.

GTP-3 and similar models will change the nature of work for many industries in the coming years. And that's just the tip of the iceberg visible to the public.  We can't begin to fathom what's going on the most secret labs of tech giants around the world.


In some ways we were all expecting this moment to arrive sooner or later. But I suppose we expected fireworks and big shebang. Instead, we are going to get a gradual but disruptive change that will catch many people off-guard.

The API access to the model is still invite-only. But there are already some mind-blowing examples flying around. I particularly enjoyed the ones in which you describe an app layout + functionality and it turns it into functioning code. Here a few:

AI hype aside. I believe this heralds a new exciting era for a true human-machine collaboration. One where people don’t have to adjust to the strict mechanistic constraints of computers. Instead, we will use our organic modes of thinking to improvise and quickly iterate on new designs and solutions - at a pace previously unthinkable.

It will enable everyone to create infinite applications perfectly attuned to their and their specific needs - all without programming or learning complex tools.
Unfortunately, it will also further obfuscate the  inner workings of the infrastructure underlying the modern world. The whimsical ‘black box’ grows bigger. Putting even more people into the abyss of utter ignorance


Some other interesting applications that I've came accross include:


Turning a normal text into a legal text


From my naive understanding it .
