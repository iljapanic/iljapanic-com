<p>Hello there online stranger!</p>
<p>My name is Ilja and I make things on the Web, mostly by typing front-end code, mocking up UIs and designing information architecture of sites.</p>
<p>I made a site that got me accepted to Copenhagen Business School, wrote a paper about Information Design and I&#39;m currently freelancing and teaching people how to make websites.</p>
<p>I&#39;m passionate about human-centred design, technology, urbanism, futurism, online culture and the study of the human mind. People who inspire me the most are Victor Papanek, Alvin Toffler and Peter Morville.</p>
<p>I drink lots of filter coffee, play basketball, read strange books and you can often find me wired to my laptop at cafe banging my head with earphones on.</p>
<p>Get in touch if you&#39;d like to create something together!</p>
