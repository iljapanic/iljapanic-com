<p>Hello there online stranger!</p>
<p>My name is Ilja and I make things on the Web, mostly by typing front-end code and designing information architecture.</p>
<p>I wrote a cover letter at <a href="http://takemetodenmark.com" target="_blank">takemetodenmark.com</a> that got me accepted to Copenhagen Business School, later I&#39;ve turned it into a site to help others study in Denmark. I wrote a <a href="http://iljapanic.me/information-design/" target="_blank">bachelor project about Information Design</a> and I&#39;m currently freelancing and <a href="http://webcrashcourse.org" target="_blank">teaching people how to make websites</a>. </p>
<p>I&#39;m passionate about human-centered design, technology, urbanism, futurism, online culture and the study of the human mind. People who inspire me the most are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Papanek" target="_blank">Victor Papanek</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Toffler" target="_blank">Alvin Toffler</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Morville" target="_blank">Peter Morville</a>.</p>
<p>I drink lots of filter coffee, play basketball, read strange books and you can usually find me wired to my laptop banging my head with headphones on.</p>
<p>Get in touch if you&#39;d like to create something together!</p>
