<p>Hello there online stranger!</p>
<p>My name is Ilja and I make things on the Web, mostly by typing front-end code, mocking up UIs and designing information architecture.</p>
<p>I made a site that got me accepted to university in Denmark, wrote a paper about Information Design, worked at a couple of agencies and now I&#39;m freelancing, teaching people how to make websites and looking for the meaning of life.</p>
<p>I&#39;m passionate about human-centered design, technology, urbanism, futurism, online culture and the study of the human mind. People who inspire me are Victor Papanek, Alvin Toffler, Peter Morville and Elon Musk.</p>
<p>I drink lots of filter coffee, play basketball, read weird books and you can often find me at a cafe wired to my laptop banging my head to electronic music.</p>
<p>Get in touch if you&#39;d like to create something together!</p>
