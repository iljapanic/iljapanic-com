<p>My name is Ilja, born in Yugoslavia and raised in the magical city of Prague.</p>
<p>My first fully handmade website got me accepted to school in Denmark.</p>
<p>I was fiddling with Web technologies since responsive became a thing.</p>
<p>In 201</p>
<p>d moved to Copenhagen in 2012.</p>
<p>I loved technology since I was a kid.</p>
<p>In 2012 it helped</p>
<p>During my time in Denmark I graduated from Information Management, wrote a <a href="https://iljapanic.github.io/panic-bachelor" title="Going Beyond HCI: Information design for knowledge-sharing platforms and information-seeking behavior support in the context of travel">paper about Information Design</a>.</p>
<p>During this time I&#39;ve worked at two agencies, did some freelance gigs and got my hands dirty with several side projects (<a href="http://informationbomb.net" title="Information Bomb">1</a>, <a href="http://takemetodenmark.com" title="Take Me To Denmark">2</a>, <a href="http://urbancultures.co" title="Urban Cultures">3</a>).</p>
<p>I&#39;m passionate about design, technology, urbanism and its impact on human mind and our information society. I love going to conferences and meetups, I run on strong coffee and tasty food and I&#39;m a late-night impulsive domain buyer.</p>
