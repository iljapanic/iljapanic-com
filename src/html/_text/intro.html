<p>Hello there online stranger!</p>
<p>My name is Ilja and Iâ€™ve been building for the Web since responsive became a thing.</p>
<p>Raised in the magical city of Prague. Since 2012 I&#39;m based in Denmark where I graduated from Information Management at Copenhagen Business School. During this time I&#39;ve worked at several agencies and had couple of freelance gigs.</p>
<p>I&#39;m passionate about design, technology, futurism, urbanism and its impact on human mind and our information society. I love going to conferences and meetups, I run on strong coffee and tasty food and I&#39;m a late-night impulsive domain buyer.</p>
<p>I&#39;m always open to interesting projects and opportunities so don&#39;t hesitate to get in touch!</p>
