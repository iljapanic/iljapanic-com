<p>Hello there online stranger!</p>
<p>My name is Ilja and I make things on the Web.</p>
<p>I specialize in information architecture, product UX strategy and front-end development. People who inspire my work are Victor Papanek, Alvin Toffler and Peter Morville.</p>
<p>I&#39;m passionate about technology, information design, urbanism, futurism, new media and intricacies of the human mind. I drink lots of filter coffee, play basketball, read strange books and listen to excentric music.</p>
<p>Get in touch if you&#39;d like to create something together!</p>
