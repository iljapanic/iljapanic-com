<p>Raised in the magical city of Prague, I&#39;ve been living in Denmark since 2012 where I graduated from Information Management at Copenhagen Business School. During this time I&#39;ve worked at two agencies, had a couple of freelance gigs and got my hands dirty with several side projects (<a href="http://informationbomb.net" title="Information Bomb">1</a>, <a href="http://takemetodenmark.com" title="Take Me To Denmark">2</a>, <a href="http://urbancultures.co" title="Urban Cultures">3</a>). Also, I wrote a <a href="https://iljapanic.github.io/panic-bachelor" title="Going Beyond HCI: Information design for knowledge-sharing platforms and information-seeking behavior support in the context of travel">paper about Information Design</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;m passionate about design, technology, urbanism and its impact on human mind and our information society. I love going to conferences and meetups, I run on strong coffee and tasty food and I&#39;m a late-night impulsive domain buyer.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t hesitate to get in touch if you got an interesting project to share or just to say hi!</p>
