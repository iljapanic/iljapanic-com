<p>I&#39;m a professional generalist. Technically, I&#39;m most comfortable at the Web front-end. Conceptually, I use a broad knowledge of a relationship between people and digital medium to design meaningful information products and build well-organized information structures. I believe in honest design and technology on a human scale.</p>
