Hello there online stranger!

My name is Ilja and I make things on the Web.

I specialize in information architecture, product UX strategy and front-end development. People who inspire my work are Victor Papanek, Alvin Toffler and Peter Morville.

I'm passionate about technology, information design, urbanism, futurism, new media and intricacies of the human mind. I drink lots of filter coffee, play basketball, read strange books and listen to excentric music.

Get in touch if you'd like to create something together!
