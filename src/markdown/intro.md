Hello there online stranger!

My name is Ilja and I make things on the Web, mostly by typing front-end code, mocking up UIs and designing information architecture.

I made a site that got me accepted to university in Denmark, wrote a paper about Information Design, worked at a couple of agencies and now I'm freelancing and teaching people how to make websites.

I'm passionate about human-centered design, technology, urbanism, futurism, online culture and the study of the human mind. People who inspire me are Victor Papanek, Alvin Toffler, Peter Morville and Elon Musk.

I drink lots of filter coffee, play basketball, read weird books and you can often find me at a cafe wired to my laptop banging my head to electronic music.

Get in touch if you'd like to create something together!
