Hello there online stranger!

My name is Ilja and I make things on the Web, mostly by typing front-end code, mocking up UIs and designing information architecture of sites.

I made a site that got me accepted to Copenhagen Business School, wrote a paper about Information Design and I'm currently freelancing and teaching people how to make websites.

I'm passionate about human-centred design, technology, urbanism, futurism, online culture and the study of the human mind. People who inspire me the most are Victor Papanek, Alvin Toffler and Peter Morville.

I drink lots of filter coffee, play basketball, read strange books and you can often find me wired to my laptop at cafe banging my head with earphones on.

Get in touch if you'd like to create something together!
