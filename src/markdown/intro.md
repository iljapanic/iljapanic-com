Hello there online stranger!

My name is Ilja and I make things on the Web, mostly by typing front-end code and designing information architecture.

Some of my personal projects include:
- <a href="http://informationbomb.net/" target="_blank">Information Bomb</a>
- <a href="http://takemetodenmark.com" target="_blank">Take Me To Denmark</a>
- <a href="http://iljapanic.me/information-design/" target="_blank">Going Beyond HCI: Information Design</a>

I'm passionate about human-centered design, technology, urbanism, online culture and the study of the human mind. People who inspire me the most are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Papanek" target="_blank">Victor Papanek</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Toffler" target="_blank">Alvin Toffler</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Morville" target="_blank">Peter Morville</a>.

I drink lots of filter coffee, play basketball, read strange books and you can usually find me wired to my laptop banging my head with headphones on.

Get in touch if you'd like to create something together!
