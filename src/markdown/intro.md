Hello there online stranger!

My name is Ilja and I make things on the Web.

I'm passionate about technology, information design, urbanism, futurism, new media and intricacies of the human mind. I drink lots of filter coffee, play basketball, read strange books and listen to excentric music.

Get in touch if you'd like to create something together!
