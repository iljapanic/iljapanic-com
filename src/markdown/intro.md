Hello there online stranger!

My name is Ilja and Iâ€™ve been building for the Web since responsive became a thing.

Raised in the magical city of Prague. Since 2012 I'm based in Denmark where I graduated from Information Management at Copenhagen Business School. During this time I've worked at several agencies and had couple of freelance gigs.

I'm passionate about design, technology, futurism, urbanism and its impact on human mind and our information society. I love going to conferences and meetups, I run on strong coffee and tasty food and I'm a late-night impulsive domain buyer.

I'm always open to interesting projects and opportunities so don't hesitate to get in touch!
