Raised in the magical city of Prague, I've been living in Denmark since 2012 where I graduated from Information Management at Copenhagen Business School. During this time I've worked at two agencies, had a couple of freelance gigs and got my hands dirty with several side projects ([1][410afde3], [2][719b5ad5], [3][e68c244a]). Also, I wrote a [paper about Information Design][8d07bf5b].

I'm passionate about design, technology, urbanism and its impact on human mind and our information society. I love going to conferences and meetups, I run on strong coffee and tasty food and I'm a late-night impulsive domain buyer.

Don't hesitate to get in touch if you got an interesting project to share or just to say hi!
