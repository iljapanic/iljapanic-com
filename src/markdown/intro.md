My name is Ilja, born in Yugoslavia and raised in the magical city of Prague.


My first fully handmade website got me accepted to school in Denmark.



I was fiddling with Web technologies since responsive became a thing.

In 201

d moved to Copenhagen in 2012.


I loved technology since I was a kid.

In 2012 it helped


During my time in Denmark I graduated from Information Management, wrote a [paper about Information Design][8d07bf5b].


During this time I've worked at two agencies, did some freelance gigs and got my hands dirty with several side projects ([1][410afde3], [2][719b5ad5], [3][e68c244a]).

I'm passionate about design, technology, urbanism and its impact on human mind and our information society. I love going to conferences and meetups, I run on strong coffee and tasty food and I'm a late-night impulsive domain buyer.

Get in touch if you'd like to share your project or create something together!
