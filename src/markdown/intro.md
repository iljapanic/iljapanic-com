My name is Ilja, I was born in Yugoslavia and raised in the magical city of Prague. In 2012 I made a website that got me accepted to Information Management program at Copenhagen Business School. I’ve been playing around with Web technologies ever since. During my time at university I’ve worked at two agencies, had some freelance gigs, wrote a paper about Information Design and worked on several side projects.

I'm passionate about design, urbanism, online culture and the impact of technology on human mind and our transition into an information society. I drink filter coffee, play basketball, cook thai and italian food, have a never-ending reading list and like to attend conferecens and meetups.
