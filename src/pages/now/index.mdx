I've decided to finally start getting more into educational space. I've been dreaming about teaching for years. Now I finally feel confident enough in my own thinking processes to share them with others.

I'm currently outlining a series of workshops and lectures about networked note-taking and other methods for personal knowledge management. I'm also putting together an advanced web development course for developers that are still making sites with Wordpress. 

I hope that the themes and overal messaging will crystalize in the following weeks and months so I can have a clearer focus.
