At the moment, I'm flashing out personal goals after reconciling the strange year that has passed.

2021 is all about sharing for me. I plan to finally get more into education space with public talks, workshops and university lectures. I would like to start publishing more of my writings and push forward the knowledge sharing groups that I've been curating for a while now.

Stay tuned and sign up for updates below so you know when I publish new content.
