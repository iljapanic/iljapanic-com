I've decided to finally start getting more into educational space. I've been dreaming about teaching for years. Now I finally feel confident enough in my own thinking processes to be able to share them with others.

I'm outlining a series of workshops and lectures about networked note-taking methods and other methods of personal knowledge management. I will offer those to individuals, universities and companies. I'm also considering offering courses of advanced web development for devs that are still making sites with Wordpress. 

I hope that the themes and overal messaging will crystalize in the following weeks and months so I can clearer focus.

Sign up for updates below so you know when it's out.
