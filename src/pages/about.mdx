I've been making on the web since 2010. I've worked as a developer for agencies, consulted startups with their business strategies, and designed experiences for various clients. Over the years, I've studied informatics, information management, urban analytics, and digital fabrication at different institutions across Europe.

I’m fascinated with sociotechnical systems and how they mediate our collective psyche. The leitmotif of my practice revolves around emergent technologies, information architecture, knowledge management, interaction design and phenomenology of perception.

I deconstruct complex ideas into something that everyone can understand. On a more practical note, I design solutions that make sense and are easy to navigate.
