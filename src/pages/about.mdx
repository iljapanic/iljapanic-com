I've been making on the web for 10+ years. I've started by hacking together WordPress sites. You know, back when editing a live site over an unsecured FTP connection seemed completely fine.

Then I've worked as a front-end developer at agencies and over time, I was naturally inclining to UX design. Probably due to its more pronounced  psychological and cultural connotations. After that, I ended up freelancing for a few years. Mostly delivering end-to-end brochure websites and consulting early-stage startups with information architecture and UX strategy.

For the past 2.5 years I've been focused on product design, mostly in the SaaS space and more recently in the field of consumer cybersecurity.

Academically, I have a background in informatics, information management, urban analytics, and digital fabrication. Iâ€™m fascinated with sociotechnical systems and how they mediate our collective psyche.

I like exploring ideas around tools for thought, media ecologies and interspecies cybernetics.
