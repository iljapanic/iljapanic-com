## 🏁 Challenge

I will spend an hour discussing someone's idea or a project every weekday in November 2020.

## 📋️ Format

- Book a time slot
- Fill out a brief
- We hop on a call together
- We discuss your project or idea

## 🎁 What to expect?

I will help you deconstruct your project into digestible chunks and offer potentially new ways of looking at it. This will make it easier for you to make sense of it and plan your work. I won't give you a specific advice or plan of action. But I might recommend tools, methods and materials to look into to help you on your way.

## 🧙🏼 Why talk to me?

Over the years, I have naturally built up a reputation of a person that people come to consult when they are working on something new or complex.
I'm also known to know a little something about everything.
I have eclectic academic background and 8+ years of experience working in tech.

## 🤭 Disclosure

We won't be signing an NDA or any sort of formal agreement. If you tell me you don't want me to share your project withy anyone I will honour your wish. You will have to take my word for it.

## 🚀 Sounds good?
