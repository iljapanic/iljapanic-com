# Hi! I’m Ilja — I research complex systems and make them easier to understand

Head over to [about](./about/) to learn more about my background and what I do. Take a look at my [virtual bookshelf](./bookshelf/) or read [articles and essays](./articles/) I wrote over the course of various studies. Or check out what I'm working on [now](./now/).

I've been postponing the redesign of this website for years. So I've decided to publish it as-is and work on it in small iterations. Over time I will add more sections and showcases of my work.

Drop your email below and I will let you know when I update the site and publish new content.
