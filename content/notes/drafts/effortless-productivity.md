I’m guilty of productivity porn as much as the other

Poured hours into reading and researching. Rarely have I applied something verbatim. 

After trying probably at least a hundred tools and countless systems and approaches here are some of the meta principles I now follow and that seems to be working well for me. 

easy and quick input is essential, if you open a tool and wonder what to do, it’s a wrong tool. Use something that is so effortless it becomes muscle memory and moving the icon feels 

Drain regulalry - don’t let it pile up, follow a schedule but also don’t resist the urge to do it impromptu. Sometimes i find myself procrastinating by cleaning up my inbox and that is ultimately a good thing, despite feeling unproductive in the moment.

Principles over tools - Stop looking for a panacea - I can confidently say that tools that try to do everything inevitably introduce compromises in some areas. For every area of your life choose a tool that feels most natural and effortless

Assume AI will clean up after you - this is a fairly recent principle but by now it’s safe to assume that AI will soon help you find what you need regardless of how messy your systems are. So stop worrying about where to put what and prioritize effortless capture.
