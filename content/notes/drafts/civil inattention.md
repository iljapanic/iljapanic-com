# Civil inattention


> [Civil inattention](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Civil_inattention) is the respectful recognition of a stranger in an urban public space without treating them as an object of [curiosity](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Curiosity "Curiosity") or [intent](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Intention "Intention").[](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Civil_inattention#cite_note-1): 110  Civil inattention establishes that each recognizes the other's [personhood](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Personhood "Personhood") without engagement. For example, people passing on a street will typically glance at each other, noticing and then withdrawing their attention. This minimal recognition is contrasted with other interactions such as the "hate stare" of the racist or the refusal to notice a [begger](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Begging "Begging"). Civil inattention is one of [Irving Goffman](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Irving_Goffman "Irving Goffman")'s most celebrated concepts in his analyses of the [rituals](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Ritual "Ritual") of public conduct in everyday life.
