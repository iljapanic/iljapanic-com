Martin Fowler defines it in [his essay](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SemanticDiffusion.html) like:

> Semantic diffusion occurs when you have a word that is coined by a person or group, often with a pretty good definition, but then gets spread through the wider community in a way that weakens that definition. This weakening risks losing the definition entirely - and with it any usefulness to the term.
