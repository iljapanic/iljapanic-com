I like to think of LLM outputs as clay.

An initial lump of malleable material to further work on.

I found this analogy applies particularly well for working with text.

Often times, I find that I procrastinate on a writing task beca

when you have to start with a blank page.

LLMs let you transform a fuzzy argument outline into a body of coherent text. 


Editing and wordsmithing is the most enjoyable part of the writing process.

LLMs let you cut to that part much more quickly.
