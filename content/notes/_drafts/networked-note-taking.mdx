Operating systems conditioned us to perceive a folder-based top-down hierarchical structure as the primary way to organize information in our virtual workspaces. This approach to knowledge management breaks our flow and creates unnecessary friction in our thinking.

Networked note-taking is a more organic approach to capture and manage your stream of ideas and is better aligned with how our minds work. A method that allows structure and connections to surface themselves from the bottom up.
