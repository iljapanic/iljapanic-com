Panpsychism views consciousness as a ubiquitous property of the universe - an invisible field permeating the universe.

It positions consciousness outside of any specific medium. 

According to some proponents we can think of human brain as strong receiver of this field.


A philosophical view that asserts the existence of a proto-consciousness as a ubiquitous property of the universe, rather than something specific to human mind.

The socio-cultural theories of distributed consciousness are gradually being corroborated with findings from quantum-relativistic physics which increasingly lend support to formerly esoteric ideas such as the existence of infinite timeliness and parallel universes.



> Panpsychism is the view that mentality is fundamental and ubiquitous in the natural world. The view has a long and venerable history in philosophical traditions of both East and West, and has recently enjoyed a revival in analytic philosophy. For its proponents panpsychism offers an attractive middle way between physicalism on the one hand and dualism on the other. The worry with dualism—the view that mind and matter are fundamentally different kinds of thing—is that it leaves us with a radically disunified picture of nature, and the deep difficulty of understanding how mind and brain interact. And whilst physicalism offers a simple and unified vision of the world, this is arguably at the cost of being unable to give a satisfactory account of the emergence of human and animal consciousness. Panpsychism, strange as it may sound on first hearing, promises a satisfying account of the human mind within a unified conception of nature.
