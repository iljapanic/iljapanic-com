A term used by [Timothy Morton](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timothy_Morton) to describe the inseparable connection and participation of humans in the context of the wider ecosphere. It implies a non-hierarchical solidarity of humans with nonhumans and it stems from the critique of the use of word ‘nature’ which arbitrarily separates humans from the rest of the living systems surrounding us.
