A term used by [Timothy Morton](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timothy_Morton) to describe the inseparable connection and participation of humans in the context of the wider ecosphere. It implies a non-hierarchical solidarity of humans with nonhumans, and it stems from the critique of the use of the word ‘nature’ which arbitrarily separates humans from the rest of the living systems surrounding us.

There is no separate nature somewhere out there, we are nature, nature is us. The dire state of our planet implies a dire state of humanity. By fixing ourselves and our relationships with others, we will fix our planet as well.
