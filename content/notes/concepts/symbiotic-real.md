A concept used by [Timothy Morton](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Timothy_Morton) to describe the inseparable connection and participation of humans in the context of the wider ecosphere. It implies a non-hierarchical solidarity of humans with nonhumans. It stems from the critique of the use of word ‘nature’ which arbitrarily separates humans from the rest of the living systems surrounding us.
