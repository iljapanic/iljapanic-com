	A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by
	their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked
	through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are
	published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.
	They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal
	websites we're used to seeing.

	A digital garden is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a
	blog, where digital gardeners share seeds of thoughts to be cultivated in
	public. Contrary to a blog, where articles and essays have a publication date
	and start decaying as soon as they are published, a digital garden is
	evergreen: digital gardeners keep on editing and refining their notes.
