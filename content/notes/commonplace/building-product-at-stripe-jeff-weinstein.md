A very insightful conversation about (really) talking to customers and building successful products from 0 to 100

- Jeff talks about deceptively simple principles that take a lot of focus discipline to get right and put to practice in day to day
- Don’t use arbitrary metrics that are easy to track
- Make sure come up with metrics that align with the overaching company mission
- To uncover people’s pains you need to look and ask about their whole life, beyond the narrow contstraints of your product, look for moments in that person’s day that are critical to them
- Look to build products which when they stop working people will immediately stop whatever they are doing a call you to get it fixed - that way you know you are solving a real problem for people
- Talk to customers, care about them and their lives, be humble
- Disregards feedback from friends and peers, they will always look to compliment you
- People will tell you they are interested and that they like the product, but they will budge if you ask for money, so ask for a payment (or even a pre-payment) early - that is a sure way to validate a product-market fit
- [7 Powers: The Foundations of Business Strategy by Hamilton Helmer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01MRLFFQ7?qid=&sr=) - seems like a great read, founder of Stripe credits it for their success
