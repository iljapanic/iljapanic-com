I've been designing and developing products for the past ten years, mostly for the web. I've worked with clients from digital agencies, nonprofits, and early-stage startups, to established SaaS companies and large enterprises.

I have a penchant for thoughtful design, clear information architecture and meticulously crafted frontends.

I strive to approach my practice with a critical eye, stemming from my eclectic academic background in complex systems and emergent technologies.

When I am not in front of the screen, you can find me sifting through piles of obscure books, brewing coffee, and dabbling with electronics.
