I've been making products on the web for a better part of a decade. I have a penchant for thoughtful design, clear information architecture and meticulously crafted frontends.

I've worked with clients ranging from digital agencies, nonprofits, and early-stage startups, to established SaaS companies and large enterprises. Some of the companies Iâ€™ve collaborated in the recent past include [Avast](https://avast.com/), [GoodData](https://gooddata.com/), and [Phrase](https://phrase.com/).

I strive to approach my practice with a critical eye, stemming from my eclectic academic background in complex systems and emergent technologies.

When I am not in front of the screen, you can find me sifting through piles of obscure books, brewing coffee, and dabbling with electronics.
