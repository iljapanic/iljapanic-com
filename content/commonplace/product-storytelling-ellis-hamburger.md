A great interview with [[Ellis Hamburger]] about [[Product storytelling]] and the importance of owning a narrative as a product.


**Relentlessly ask ‚ÄúWhy does that matter?‚Äù**: Drill down on every product feature or benefit until you reach a core human need or emotional driver‚Äîdon‚Äôt stop at surface-level answers.

**Prioritize evocation over information**: Great copy makes users feel something; focus on emotional resonance, not just functional descriptions.

**Lead with unique, shareable ideas‚Äînot just features:** Anchor your messaging in philosophies or beliefs that transcend your product and invite cultural participation.

**Use story as a tool for strategic alignment:** A strong narrative unifies disparate features, clarifies priorities, and aligns both internal teams and external messaging.

**Distill your product‚Äôs essence into memorable, actionable mantras:** Create short, opinionated phrases (e.g., ‚Äúsimple apps over super apps‚Äù) that guide decisions and are easy to remember.

**Let founder and creator voices drive communication:** In a crowded market, authentic and transparent leadership is more compelling than generic brand messaging.

**Treat onboarding and first impressions as narrative moments:** Invest in onboarding like it‚Äôs a movie trailer‚Äîprime users emotionally, convey your philosophy, and create delight from the start.
