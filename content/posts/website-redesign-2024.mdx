## Goals

I wanted to create something that doesn't require active maintenance but doesn't look abandoned. 

With the usual navigation in the header, visitors are invited to browse the site like any other website, expecting to see most recent posts in each section. By getting rid of the main navigation, and flattening everything into a simple forwards/backwards motion.



Stack:

[Keystatic](https://keystatic.com/) for managing content, mainly JSON files for Bookshelf and Tools.

Long-form content is stored in MDX files in the `content` directory and I use [Contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev/) to display the data on the frontend.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
