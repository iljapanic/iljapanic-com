*[What is a ‘now page’?](https://nownownow.com/about)*

Currently, I'm building the tech behind [Converge](https://www.theconvergence.co/request-access), a platform that I co-founded with my long-time friend [Daniel](https://www.danielcervenka.com/). We are still figuring out what exactly it is that we’re making, but the  positive reactions so far seem to suggest we're onto something that many people in the impact and climate space will find useful to facilitate better information exchange and collaboration opportunities.

When I'm not writing code or designing I strive to spend as much time as possible with my newborn daughter.
