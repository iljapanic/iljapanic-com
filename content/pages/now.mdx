_[What is a ‘now page’?](https://nownownow.com/about)_

Currently, I'm building out [Converge](https://convergespace.co), a knowledge-sharing platform for the climate and impact space that I co-founded with my long-time friend [Daniel](https://www.danielcervenka.com/).

When I'm not writing code or designing, I try to spend as much time as possible with my newborn daughter.
