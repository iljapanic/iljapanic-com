My work typically fits under the umbrellas of UX and interface design, product development and programming. But I'm a generalist at heart, so most titles and disciplines seem fickle and fleeting.

At the end of the day, I love tinkering with new technologies and exploring our individual and collective relationships with them. I'm passionate about the web as a medium and love crafting experiences on it.
