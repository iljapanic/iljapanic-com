I'm a generalist at heart, so I tend to find titles and disciplines to be fickle and fleeting. My work typically fits under the umbrellas of UX and interface design, product development and programming.

At the end of the day, I love tinkering with new technologies and exploring our individual and collective relationships with them. I'm passionate about the web as a medium and love crafting experiences on it.
