This personal site is an ongoing learning experience.

Therfore it's seriously overengineered given the scope and the purpose of the site.

Things will likely change and sometimes even break.

As it goes with the personal sites it's a never ending endevour. I typically go througt several iterations, experimenting with unusual designs and approaches, just to end up at the clean and minimal style.

## Next.js

## Typography

Body fonts uses `ui-serif` and headings are set in `ui-sans-serif`. Using system fonts improves performance and results in smaller footprint. Also, it makes the site look more native to the operating system. Check out ??? to se what renders on different operating systems.

Font sizes are fluid and scale with the viewport width. I've used the [tailwindcss-fluid-type](https://github.com/davidhellmann/tailwindcss-fluid-type) to achieve this.

## Authoring

Uses MDX. It's like good olâ€™ Markdown but it allows you to use JSX components so you can do things like:

```md
# Markdown heading

Vestibulum id ligula porta felis euismod semper. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis.

<Book id="3322" />
```

The above example uses a custom `<Book />` component to fetch and preview a book from Airtable database which results in:

## Styles

I've always prided myself in writing entirely custom CSS for my personal site.

But after using Tailwind on many projects I've realized that maintaining a custom stylesheet and coming up with arbitrary class names is a pain in the ass.

So I've decided to use Tailwind.

Overal, this approach allowed me to focus more time on typography, layout and content, instead of wrangling CSS.

I hope it will allow me to iterate more quickly and lower the friction for implementing new ideas as they come, instead of postponing them forever because my site is so tightly coupled to whatever mindset I had when I originally made the site.
