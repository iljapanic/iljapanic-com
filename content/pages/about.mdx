I’ve been enamored with the web as a medium since the first moment I opened a web browser as a kid back in the late 90s. I’ve been exploring personal computing and tinkering with digital technologies ever since.

Professionally, I’ve been building products on the web for a little over a decade. I specialize in strategic UX design and web development with a penchant for clear information architecture, design systems, and bespoke frontends.

I have worked with agencies, startups, non-profits, artists, small vendors, medium SaaS companies, and large corporations. I’m used to mediating between business, product, and development teams. I have experience leading design initiatives, establishing design processes, and shaping the overall design direction of organizations.

I strive to approach my practice with a critical eye, stemming from my eclectic academic background in complex systems and emergent technologies. Besides day-to-day work, I dabble with 3D printing, parametric and generative design, programming microcontrollers, digging through records, and collecting obscure books.
