Titles and disciplines are fickle and fleeting. Broadly speaking, my work tends to fit under the umbrellas of UX design, interface design, product development and programming.

I'm passionate about the web as a medium and love crafting experiences on it. I've been at it for 10+ years now.

I started off as frontend developer at agencies followed by a few years of freelancing – mostly building brochure websites and consulting early stage startups on UX strategy.

Then I've spent some time doing product design at medium-sized SaaS companies and leading a UX team at one the largest consumer cybersecurity companies. 

Now, I'm building the tech behind [Converge](https://www.theconvergence.co/request-access) – a platform for facilitating collaboration and information exchange between people and organizations in impact and climate space.

Academically, I have a background in informatics, information management, smart cities & urban analytics, and digital fabrication. I still have a penchant for obscure academic genres such as media ecologies, digital anthropology, interspecies cybernetics or tools for thought. I will probably end up back in academia at some point in my life.

I'm currently based in Prague, Czech Republic after many years of living abroad.
