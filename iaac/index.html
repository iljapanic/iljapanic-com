          <h3>Going Beyond HCI <span class="year">2015</span><br><span class="subtitle">Information design for knowledge-sharing platforms in the context of travel</span></h3>
          <div class="item__body">
            <p>My final bachelor project traces the history of the formalisation of design. The paper criticises techno-centric methods and reviews theoretical underpinnings of information design – an approach that strives for edification and personal enlightenment. The analysis applies the principles of information design to conceptualise a knowledge-sharing platform for travellers.</p>
            <blockquote>“By framing people's problems as mere features in vast information systems, we fail to address the more fundamental issues of how people perceive and interact with the information around them on day-to-day basis. We judge the quality of the system by the number of features it has, rather than how it enhances our lives.”</blockquote>

          <h3>(Not So) Smart City <span class="year">2018</span><br><span class="subtitle">Technological determinism and the perils of data-driven approach to urban planning</span></h3>
          <div class="item__body">
            <p>This paper argues that existing approaches to smart city design are rooted in a techno-centric mindset that is not suitable for urban problems that are inherently social. The paper first examines the problematic aspects of the current smart city discourse driven primarily by business interests. It then critically analyses underlying principles of the dominant data-driven smart city ideology, followed by an alternative vision of smart city based on citizen engagement.</p>
            <blockquote>“The vision of all-seeing sentient city driven by business interests poses a danger of creating private cities, exuberating inequality and social polarisation by creating a ‘capsular society’ dominated by the cultures and biopolitics of separation and continuous digital filtering and tracking.”</blockquote>

          <h3>China’s all-seeing ‘Sharp Eyes’ <span class="year">2018</span><br><span class="subtitle">A surveillance perspective of the smart city</span></h3>
          <div class="item__body">
            <p>The paper uses the example of China's expanding surveillance systems to discuss some of the worrisome aspects of deploying omnipresent ICT infrastructures in cities. It then sets the discussion in a broader context of the dominant smart city narrative driven by principles of surveillance capitalism.</p>
            <blockquote>“The global smart city agenda enacted through ‘winner-take-all’ mechanisms of surveillance capitalism is characterised by significant information asymmetries and unequal power dynamics that are poised to widen social and economic inequalities. […] Instead, the smart city needs to viewed as a process of ever-present urbanisation in an all-pervasive, invisible global metropolis that extends urban modalities of living to everyone, whether they live in a city or not.”</blockquote>
